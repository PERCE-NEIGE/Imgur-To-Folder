# Imgur-To-Folder
Download Imgur albums and images to desired folder


### Updates to Readme will come with full explanations 

So far: 

Images, gifs, and mp4s can be downloaded from imgur into a directory you can assign within the script. 

Images and mp4's seem to download with no noticible compression. This is being compared with the 'original' images and mp4's hosted on i.imgur.com.

The only exception so far is that gifs to tend to be downloaded at a lesser quality but this is being looked into.
